<p>The goal of a SILLY script is the construction of an instance of the <i>Scene</i> predefined class. A SILLY script is composed by a list of sections, and there are special sections for each part of the scene:</p>

<ul type=disc>
  <li><b>sampler</b><br>A <a href="silly_samplers.html">sampler</a> controls the rendering algorithm by determining how many light rays must be traced for each pixel in the final image, and how the information obtained from those rays is combined.</li>
  <li><b>camera</b><br>The <a href="silly_cameras.html">camera</a> specifies the size of the rendered image and the mapping from pixels in that image to rays in the 3D space, also known as <i>projection</i>.</li>
  <li><b>background</b><br>The <a href="silly_backs.html">background</a> object is used when a light ray doesn't hit any other shape in the scene, and maps rays to color values.</li>
  <li><b>lights</b><br>A <a href="silly_lights.html">light source</a> has a location and a color, which can be different according to the direction.</li>
  <li><b>media</b><br>You can simulate some simple atmospheric phenomena, such as constant and ground fog, by including a <b>media</b> section in your scene.</li>
  <li><b>ambient</b><br>An <a href="silly_amb.html">ambient light</a> is different from a regular light source in that it can't be blocked by any shape.</li>
  <li><b>objects</b><br>The list of <a href="silly_shapes.html">shapes</a> in the scene.</li>
</ul>

<p align=justify>The <i>sampler</i>, <i>camera</i> and <i>background</i> sections allow only one object to be attached, while <i>ambient</i>, <i>lights</i> and <i>objects</i> allow a list of objects. <i>Sampler</i> and <i>camera</i> are mandatory, since they have no sensible default values. You can omit any other section. A missing background means a black <a href="silly_backs.html#flat">flat blackground</a>, and a missing ambient means no <a href="silly_amb.html">ambient light</a> at all.</p>

<h2>Sampler</h2>

<p align="justify">The <a href="silly_samplers.html">sampler</a>, together with the camera lens, define a virtual camera. The sampler represents the photosensible element responsible for the recording of light rays (the film, or the electronic CCD in digital cameras).</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>

<p align="justify">Since we live in a 3D world, we need to map points in the 3D space to pixels in the 2D image generated by the ray tracer. This is the job of the <a href="silly_cameras.html">camera</a>.</p>

<h2>Lighting: light sources</h2>

<p align="justify">There are four predefined <a href="silly_lights.html">light source</a> classes: <i>point lights</i>, <i>parallel lights</i>, <i>spot lights</i> and <i>spherical lights</i>, also called <i>globes</i>.</p>

<h2>Lighting: ambient light</h2>

<p align="justify">We have also included a <i>local ambient</i>, a kind of ambient light which doesn't have a real world equivalence. This is an ambient light with a decay factor, proportional to the inverse of the squared distance from a designated point.</p>

<h2>Lighting: background</h2>

<p align="justify">XSight already implements most frequently used <a href="silly_backs.html">backgrounds</a>: a flat background, a gradient background and a simulation of a clouded sky.</p>
